%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Function dilation_s %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Purpose:  
%      Compute dilation of an input image X with respect to an input 
%      structural element A. Note that the dimension of the structuring 
%      element must be odd, so that A = A^s is possible
%      
%
% Input Variables:
%      X       MxN input 2D binary image to be eroded
%      A       rxc structuring element, r and c are both odd
%      
% Returned Results:
%      newimg  Result after dilation
%
% Processing Flow:
%      1.  Padding image with 0s, so that the border of the image could 
%          processed propery
%      2.  For each valid pixel (x,y) in X, check whether the stucturing 
%          element A can hit X after translate with (x,y)
%             If yes, in the dilation image newimg, newimg(x,y) = 1
%             Otherwise, newimg(x,y) = 0
%
%  Restrictions/Notes:
%      This function only takes an structuring element of odd dimensions.  
%
%  The following functions are called:
%      none
