%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Function erosion %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Purpose:  
%      Compute erosion of an input image X with respect to an input 
%      structuring element A. Note that the number of rows and columns of A
%      must be odd, so that A = A^s is possible.
%      
%
% Input Variables:
%      X       MxN input 2D binary image to be eroded
%      A       rxc structuring element, r and c are both odd
%      
% Returned Results:
%      B       Result after erosion
%
% Processing Flow:
%      1.  Padding image with 0s, so that the border of the image could 
%          processed propery
%      2.  For each valid pixel (i,j) in X, check whether the stucturing 
%          element A can be included in X after translate with (i,j)
%             If yes, in the erosion image B, B(i,j) = 1
%             Otherwise, B(i,j) = 0
%
%  Restrictions/Notes:
%      X and A must be binary images.
%      The number of rows and columns of A must be odd. 
%      
%  The following functions are called:
%      none
